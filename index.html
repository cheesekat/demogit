    <p>Top Three: <br> 1. For hungry people who are indecisive, The Food Wheel, is a web page that lets you input your favorite restaurants and it displays them 
      around a spinner, then you tap the spinner to spin the arrow, choosing the restaurant for you. Unlike GrubHub, our product makes deciding fun.

    2. For forgetful people who take daily medications, The Pill Tracker, is an app that reminds the user to take their medication, keeps track of it and also 
      when to refill prescriptions. Unlike your brain, our product makes it possible to stay consistent.

    3. For parents who like to plan a variety of activities for their kids, The Weather Kid, is a weather app that displays the weather conditions for playgrounds 
      in the area. Unlike Weather.com, our product has fun colors and is primarily focused on playgrounds and parks.
